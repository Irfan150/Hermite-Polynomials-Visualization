# Hermite-Polynomials-Visualization
Python scripts for generating and visualizing Hermite polynomials using NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. This project explores the properties of these orthogonal polynomials and provides graphical representations up to a specified order. Developed as part of a Computational Mathematics coursework project on special functions.
